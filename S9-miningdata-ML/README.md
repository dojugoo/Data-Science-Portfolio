## Mining Company Well Data - Machine Learning

## Description

You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new well.

Steps to choose the location:
- Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;
- Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;
- Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;
- Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit using the Bootstrapping technique.

## Conclusions

I recommend the choice of Region 1 for the development of the oil wells for the goal of maximizing profit.

From this analysis, the highest average profit for oil well development would be in Region 1. Region 1 has the highest average profit of 6.64 million dollars, while Region 0 is slightly lower at about 6 million dollars.

Not only does Region 1 have the highest average profit, the risk of losses is the lowest at 0.10%, compared to Region 0 at 2.0%. We can disregard Region 2 completely, because the calculated risk of loss is at 2.5%, which does not meet our criteria.
